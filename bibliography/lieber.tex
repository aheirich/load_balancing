challenges:\\
-diffusion vs geometrical vs graph-based methods\\
-tasks are migrated based on geometrical coordinates or graph topolgogy\\
-geometrical good balance but lot of migration, e.g., gossip\\
-diffusion never really considered in HPC\\
this is a survey paper[a very good reference]:\\
- load transfer vector prepared by node to move tasks to another node\\
- CHEBY algorithm not uses difference in work load\\
- PARMETIS uses diffusion, ZOLTAN library and GLB library should be in mind\\
- chemotaxis uses capacity on me - load on target\\
- which tasks to send based on comm reduction, i.e., comm with neighbors only\\
their questions are our questions:\\
-how can we apply diffusion on todayâ€™s common hardware topologies like fat trees?\\
-What is a fast and high-quality method for task selection allowing to trade-off balance, migration and edge-cut? \\
-How do we scalably implement the termination criterion for diffusion when no fast collectives are available? E. g. use approx or auto-tune iteration count?\\
