challenges:\\
-mapping + load balancing at the same time\\
-a form of diffusion is the answer for both\\
-goals of mapping, workload balance and comm time\\
pros:\\
-based on the laplacian matrix of communicating processes\\ 
-delay and fault tolerant, insensitive to problem scale, convergence depends on initial conditions (hmm)\\
cons:\\
-np-complete problem\\
-m to be 2, planar connection networks, but arbitrary topologies like hierarchical, maybe linearization, not sure: did not understand the mapping to torus by a broadcast-type strategy, what about binomial dissemination?.\\
-reduction of the problem for a specific instance ? isnt it ?
